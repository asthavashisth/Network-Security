🔐 Network Security Threat Detection System
A Machine Learning-based project for detecting potential network threats using log data and predictive modeling. Built following MLOps principles, this system enables scalable model training, monitoring, and deployment.

📌 Project Description
This project is designed to identify phishing or malicious behavior from network logs or URLs using machine learning. The focus is not only on detection accuracy but also on how to automate the end-to-end ML lifecycle using MLOps tools.

✅ Model Training: Supervised learning with engineered features (like URL-based features, IP patterns).

⚙️ MLOps Implementation: Includes data versioning, model tracking, and pipeline automation.

📊 Monitoring & Logging: Logs predictions, exceptions, and model artifacts.

🚀 Features
✔️ Detects phishing URLs based on 30+ extracted features.

✔️ Uses scikit-learn models like Random Forest / XGBoost.

✔️ Modular code structure using OOP.

✔️ Environment handling via .env and dotenv.

✔️ MongoDB integration to store predictions/logs.

✔️ ML pipeline with MLflow or manual tracking.

✔️ Flask or Streamlit-based prediction interface.
